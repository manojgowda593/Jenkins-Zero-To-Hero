# 🚀 Ultimate End-to-End CI/CD Project

This repository contains the **code and configuration files** for implementing a complete CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline automates the software delivery process using popular DevOps tools, from source code management to deployment in a Kubernetes environment.

---

## 🌟 **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** pipeline using tools such as:

- **Jenkins**
- **SonarQube**
- **Docker**
- **Maven**
- **DockerHub**
- **Kubernetes**
- **Argo CD**

---

## 🔑 **Steps in the Pipeline**

### 1️⃣ **Source Code Management**

- The source code is hosted on **GitHub**.
- A **webhook** is set up to trigger Jenkins whenever there is a push to the repository.

### 2️⃣ **Build and Package**

- Jenkins automatically triggers a **build process** using **Maven**.
- The build ensures the source code compiles successfully and packages it into a **JAR file** for further use.

### 3️⃣ **Static Code Analysis**

- **SonarQube** is integrated into the pipeline for **static code analysis**.
- The pipeline will only proceed if the code passes all **quality checks**.

### 4️⃣ **Containerization**

- The application is **containerized** using **Docker**.
- A **Docker image** is built and pushed to **DockerHub** for deployment purposes.

### 5️⃣ **Deployment with Argo CD**

- **Kubernetes deployment manifests** are updated with the new Docker image version.
- **Argo CD** is used to automate the deployment to the Kubernetes cluster.

---

## 🔹 **Key Highlights**

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Handled by Jenkins, which builds the application and performs static code analysis using SonarQube.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Achieved using Argo CD, which automates the deployment process to Kubernetes.

---

## 🛠 **Tools Used**

- **Jenkins**: For building and automating the CI process.
- **Maven**: For building and packaging the application.
- **SonarQube**: For static code analysis.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **DockerHub**: For storing the Docker images.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating containerized applications.
- **Argo CD**: For continuous deployment and managing Kubernetes resources.

## 💡 **What I Learned**

- Gained practical experience in implementing a **CI/CD pipeline** using industry-standard tools.
- Developed a strong understanding of **tool integrations** and their contribution to automating the software delivery process.
- Learned how to deploy **containerized applications** to a Kubernetes environment using Argo CD.

## 🏃‍♂️ **How to Run This Project**

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ultimate-ci-cd-project.git](https://github.com/manojgowda593/Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero.git
   ```

2. **Set up a Jenkins instance** with necessary plugins (Maven, Docker, SonarQube).

3. **Configure the GitHub webhook** to trigger Jenkins on code push.

4. **Set up Docker** and create a **Dockerfile** for your application if you haven't already.

5. **Push the Docker image** to **DockerHub**.

6. **Deploy the application** on a **Kubernetes cluster**.

7. Use **Argo CD** for continuous deployment of the updated image to Kubernetes.
